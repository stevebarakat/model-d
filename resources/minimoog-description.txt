** Oscillator Bank **

Oscillators are the primary source of sound in
an analog synthesizer. The Minimoog Model D
OSCILLATOR BANK contains three nearly
identical Oscillators. This arrangement means
each key can sound up to three oscillators—
each with its own Waveform, Octave, and Pitch
setting—creating a deep or complex sound. The
Mixer then controls the balance between the
Oscillators.

TUNE
The tuning of Oscillator–1 is determined by the master
TUNE knob, located at the top of the CONTROLLERS panel.

RANGE
The RANGE knob selects the fundamental octave for
each oscillator over a five-octave range. A sixth LO setting
brings the pitch down even further, allowing the Oscillator
to be used for other purposes, such as a modulation source.

FREQUENCY
Oscillator–2 and Oscillator–3 are each equipped with a
FREQUENCY knob that can be used to detune the Oscillator
from the pitch of Oscillator–1. Slight amounts of detuning
can create a rich, chorusing effect. Tuning the Oscillators to
an interval (Perfect Fifth above, Perfect Fourth below, etc.)
provides a powerful voice for playing lead passages
or creating chords.

WAVEFORM
Each of the three Oscillators provides six distinct Waveform
shapes. Each waveform has a unique harmonic content that
is based on the number and strength of harmonic overtones
that it contains. These overtones are what impart a particular
timbre to the Oscillator.


WAVEFORM TYPES:
1. TRIANGLE
The Triangle wave has an extremely strong fundamental,
yet contains only odd-numbered harmonics at very low
levels. This makes the Triangle wave an ideal choice for
creating soft, flute-like sounds that have a pure tone with
little overtone activity.

2.1. TRIANGLE/SAWTOOTH (OSCILLATOR–1 AND
OSCILLATOR–2 ONLY)
This waveform is a hybrid of the Triangle and the Sawtooth
waveforms. It contains more harmonic energy than the
Triangle wave and adds in some of the even-numbered
harmonics, but it is not nearly as brash as the Sawtooth wave.
This hybrid waveform can add a little more edge than the
Triangle wave alone, allowing it to cut through the mix with
a bit more clarity.

2.2. REVERSE SAWTOOTH (OSCILLATOR–3 ONLY)
The Reverse Sawtooth has a sound similar to the regular
Sawtooth wave; it is included here primarily as a waveform
choice when using Oscillator–3 as a modulation source.

3. SAWTOOTH
The Sawtooth waveform is the most harmonically dense of
the waveforms, containing all of the natural harmonics in
relatively strong levels. In addition to creating thick, brassy
sounds, the Sawtooth waveform lends itself to powerful lead
and bass sounds as well.

4. PULSE 1/SQUARE
The harmonic content of a Pulse wave is based on the width
of the top half of the wave in relation to the bottom half of
the wave, also known as the duty-cycle. In the Square wave,
the width of these two portions of the wave is equal. As with
the Triangle wave, the Pulse 1/Square waveform contains only
odd-numbered harmonics, but with greater energy. A Square
wave provides a rich starting point for string-like sounds.

5. PULSE 2/WIDE RECTANGLE
As the Pulse wave changes from Square to Rectangular,
even-numbered harmonics are introduced, but the overall
harmonic mix is changed. The wide rectangle forms the basis
for hollow, reedy sounds.

6. PULSE 3 / NARROW RECTANGLE
As the Pulse wave continues to get narrower, lower
numbered harmonics—both odd and even—are emphasized.
The resulting timbre takes on a more nasal tone.


OSC. 3 CONTROL
Oscillator–3 is unique. Normally, all Oscillators are controlled
directly from the keyboard and Pitch wheel. Turning the
orange rocker switch to OFF releases OSCILLATOR–3 from
keyboard control, providing a greater range of frequency
control and allowing it to run free as a modulation source.

OSCILLATOR MODULATION
When this switch is set to ON, the Oscillators can be
modulated by Oscillator 3, Noise, Filter Contour, an External
Mod Source, and the LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) as
defined by the CONTROLLERS settings and the Modulation
Wheel position.




** Controllers **

Minimoog Model D contains a number of
modulation sources that can affect the pitch of
the Oscillators or the Cutoff Frequency of the
Filter. In this regard, Minimoog Model D has
been modified from its original design, and
two rocker switches have been added to the
CONTROLLERS section. Each switch selects between two modulation
sources, while the Modulation Mix knob controls
the balance between them. The Modulation
Wheel (located on the Left-Hand Keyboard
panel) controls the amount of modulation
applied to the Oscillators and/or Filter.


OSC. 3/FILTER EG SWITCH
This switch to the bottom left side of the CONTROLLERS
panel is used to choose the modulation source that
will be assigned to the counterclockwise position of the
MODULATION MIX knob. Originally, this modulation source
was fixed to OSC. 3, but this updated reissue allows FILTER
EG to be selected as well.
In the FILTER EG position, the shape defined by the ATTACK
TIME, DECAY TIME, and SUSTAIN LEVEL knobs of the Filter
Contour are used as a modulation source. Filter EG is an ideal
modulation source for creating analog brass and percussion
sounds.

NOISE/LFO SWITCH
This switch to the bottom right side of the CONTROLLERS
panel is used to choose the modulation source that will be
assigned to the clockwise position of the MODULATION MIX
knob. Originally, this modulation source was fixed to NOISE,
but this updated reissue allows LFO to be selected as well.
The NOISE switch located in the mixer selection determines
what type of noise is used for modulation. When WHITE
NOISE is selected, Pink Noise is actually the modulation
source. When PINK NOISE is selected, Red Noise is actually
the modulation source. In the LFO position, the additional
LFO located on the Left-Hand Keyboard panel is used as a
modulation source. This is ideal for pitch vibrato and trills
when all three oscillators are in use.
TIP: The Noise position can also be used to introduce an external
modulation source via the MOD. SRC. (Modulation Source) jack on
the Top Patch Panel. Inserting a standard 1/4” TS cable into this jack
breaks the normalled connection, and any external control voltage
can be used as a modulation source. Additionally, if a TRS to TS
insert cable is used, the Modulation Noise signal output is made
available on the ring/send portion of the cable.

MODULATION MIX
This knob sets the balance between the modulation sources
selected using the OSC. 3/FILTER EG and NOISE/LFO
switches. With the MODULATION MIX knob rotated fully
counterclockwise, only the modulation source selected
by the OSC. 3/FILTER EG switch is applied. With the
MODULATION MIX knob rotated fully clockwise, only the
modulation source selected by the NOISE/LFO switch is
applied. In the center position, both selected modulation
sources are applied equally



** Left-Hand Keyboard Panel **

GLIDE KNOB
Located on the CONTROLLERS panel, the GLIDE knob
determines the amount of time needed to transition from
one note to the next.

GLIDE SWITCH
Glide allows the pitch to change in a smooth, continuous
manner as you transition from note to note, rather than
instantly stepping to the new pitch. This switch turns the
Glide effect on and off.

LFO RATE
Located on the Left-Hand Keyboard panel, the LFO RATE
knob sets the speed for the dedicated LFO (Low Frequency
Oscillator) modulation source that has been added to
Minimoog Model D. Normally, the LFO uses a Triangle wave.
The LFO RATE knob is a push/pull knob allowing you to
switch the LFO waveshape between triangle and square.
Pull up slightly on the LFO RATE knob (until you hear a click)
to switch the LFO shape to square and push down on the
knob to return to triangle.

DECAY SWITCH
When the DECAY switch is ON, the last note played will
continue to sound as it fades and the Filter Cutoff Frequency
will lower at the rate set using the DECAY TIME knobs in the
MODIFIERS section (Page 28).

MOD WHEEL
The MODULATION Wheel provides a real-time performance
controller that can apply the modulation sources selected
using the OSC. 3/FILTER EG and NOISE/LFO switches, using
the mix determined by the MODULATION MIX knob. The
Oscillator Modulation switch between the CONTROLLERS
panel and the OSCILLATOR BANK must be in the ON
position to apply modulation to the Oscillator pitch. The
FILTER MODULATION switch connecting the CONTROLLER
panel and the Filter must be in the ON position to apply
modulation to the Filter Cutoff Frequency. The zero position
for the Mod Wheel is all the way down, as illustrated.

PITCH WHEEL
Located next to the MODULATION Wheel, the PITCH Wheel
provides a real-time performance controller for bending the
pitch of the Oscillators­ —in the way that a guitarist may bend
a string or a sax player may bend the reed to alter the pitch
of a note. The zero position for the PITCH Wheel is in the
center, allowing the pitch to be bent either sharp or flat. The
PITCH Wheel will go up a fifth in its maximum position and
down a fifth in its minimum position.
NOTE: The PITCH Wheel on Minimoog Model D is now spring-loaded
and will return to center on release.



** Mixer & Noise **

The Mixer sets the levels of all five of the
Minimoog Model D audio sources—3 Oscillators,
Noise Generator, and External Audio Input.
The combined output of the Mixer next
passes through the Filter and finally arrives at
the audio output. In addition to a dedicated
Volume knob, each audio source also includes
an On/Off switch. These switches allow any
source to be quickly removed from the mix
while preserving their Volume knob position,
and can also be useful when setting the
tuning of each Oscillator. The Oscillators are
somewhat self-explanatory in regard to the
Mixer. The External Input Volume and the Noise
Generator require some extra explanation.

EXTERNAL INPUT VOLUME
An external audio source can be introduced to Minimoog
Model D using the EXT. INPUT SIGNAL jack located on
the Top Patch Panel. The Volume of the external signal is
controlled using this knob.
If no cable is connected to the EXT. INPUT SIGNAL jack,
the main audio output of Minimoog Model D is attenuated
slightly and then normalled to the External Input signal path.
In this case, the Main Output signal is sent back to the input
of the mixer. By increasing the External Input volume far
enough, the Mixer can overload, introducing varying levels
of overdrive or distortion. When this occurs, the Overload
indicator lamp will light. In this case, the External Input
Volume control is post Main Output volume. This means that
the MAIN OUTPUT VOLUME knob will affect the amount of
overload in addition to the EXTERNAL INPUT VOLUME knob.
CRITICAL NOTE: With no cable connected to the EXT. INPUT
SIGNAL jack, and the EXTERNAL INPUT VOLUME and MAIN
OUTPUT VOLUME controls turned all the way up, it is possible to
overload the mixer to the point that only one sound is heard and
different pitches do not sound. This will not damage the instrument.

NOISE
Noise can be a very desirable sound source—either alone or
mixed in with other sources. It can be used to create anything
from a rocket launch to the subtle breath of a flute sound.
In addition to the NOISE VOLUME knob, there is a switch for
selecting either WHITE or PINK noise. White Noise contains
equal energy per frequency. Pink Noise contains equal
energy per octave of the audio spectrum, and is perceived
as having more low-frequency components. If you think
of White Noise as TV static, consider Pink Noise more as a
waterfall pounding the rocks below.



** Modifiers **

The MODIFIERS Panel contains three separate
sections: FILTER, FILTER CONTOUR, and
LOUDNESS CONTOUR. The Filter selectively
modifies the harmonic content of the sound.
The Contour controls, also known as Envelope
Generators, provide a control signal that
changes over time. The FILTER CONTOUR
controls the Filter’s Cutoff Frequency over time.
The LOUDNESS CONTOUR controls the output
volume level over time.

FILTER CONTROLS:
- CUTOFF FREQUENCY KNOB
Minimoog Model D is equipped with a traditional Moog
Ladder Filter with 10Hz-32kHz frequency response. This
is a critical component to the thick, punchy, and powerful
Minimoog Model D sound. When a note is played, harmonic
content occurring above the filter Cutoff Frequency is
reduced by the filter at a rate of 24dB/Octave. Harmonic
content, or sound, below the filter Cutoff Frequency will
freely pass unaffected.
This is the foundation of subtractive analog synthesis.
While the Cutoff Frequency can be set manually using the
Cutoff Frequency knob, the value is also affected by the
Keyboard Control switches, Filter Modulation switch, Filter
Contour controls, and the Amount of Contour knob, which
are discussed below. When closing the filter by lowering the
Cutoff Frequency, the sound will be perceived as growing
darker, while increasing the Filter’s Cutoff Frequency will
create a progressively brighter sound.

- EMPHASIS KNOB
Often referred to as resonance, the Emphasis knob takes a
portion of the output of the Filter and sends it back to the
input of the Filter, creating a resonance peak that occurs at
the Filter’s Cutoff Frequency. By turning the Emphasis control
up and lowering the Filter Cutoff Frequency, the Filter can
be coaxed into a self-oscillating state, acting as a sine-wave
oscillator whose pitch can be controlled or played via the
keyboard by using the Keyboard Control switches defined
below.

- FILTER MODULATION SWITCH
When this switch is on, the Filter Cutoff Frequency can be
modulated by the Noise Generator, Filter Contour, Oscillator
3, and LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator). The modulation
source and amount are defined by the CONTROLLERS
settings and the Modulation Wheel position.

- KEYBOARD CONTROL (1&2) SWITCHES
The Keyboard Control switches allow the note played on
the keyboard of Minimoog Model D to affect the Filter Cutoff
Frequency, a process also known as key tracking. This allows
notes played higher on the keyboard to have brighter sound.
Keyboard Control 1 provides 1/3 of the total amount of
available key tracking. Keyboard Control 2 provides 2/3 of
the total amount of available key tracking. By using both
switches together, the full amount of available key tracking
(1/3 + 2/3 = 1) is applied, resulting in an octave change in filter
cutoff per octave change played on the keyboard.

-CONTOUR CONTROLS
Contour controls provide a way to add
articulation to the sound of the synthesizer.
Minimoog Model D features two Contour
controls, or Envelope Generators. One
provides a signal to change the Filter
Cutoff Frequency over time. The other
provides a signal to change the Loudness
over time. In both cases, the Contour
contains three main controls: ATTACK
TIME, DECAY TIME, and SUSTAIN LEVEL.


FILTER CONTOUR:
- ATTACK TIME KNOB
The Attack Time knob sets the time required for the Filter
Contour Generator to raise the Filter’s Cutoff Frequency
from its manual setting to its maximum level (determined by
the Amount of Contour knob) once a key is pressed or after
a gate is received.

- DECAY TIME KNOB
The Decay Time knob sets the time required for the Filter
Contour Generator to lower the Filter’s Cutoff Frequency
from the level achieved by the Attack stage to the Sustain
Level. The Decay Time knob can also control the amount of
time required for the Filter to return to its manual setting
after the key is released (or after an external gate signal
ends). This second function of the Decay Time knob is
activated by the DECAY switch on the Left-Hand Keyboard.

- SUSTAIN LEVEL KNOB
After the Attack and Decay stages have been completed,
the Filter Contour Generator will hold the Filter’s Cutoff
Frequency at the level determined by the Sustain Level knob
for as long as a note is held.

- AMOUNT OF CONTOUR KNOB
The Amount of Contour knob determines how much of the
control signal created by the Filter Contour will be applied to
change the Filter Cutoff Frequency over time.


LOUDNESS CONTOUR:
- ATTACK TIME KNOB
The Attack Time knob sets the time required for the
Loudness Contour Generator to raise the Volume from zero
to its maximum level once a key is pressed or after a gate
is received.

- DECAY TIME KNOB
The Decay Time knob sets the time required for the
Loudness Contour Generator to lower the Volume from its
maximum level achieved by the Attack stage to the Sustain
Level. The Decay Time knob can also control the amount
of time required for the note to completely fade out after a
key is released (or after an external gate signal ends). This
second function of the Decay Time knob is activated by the
DECAY switch, located on the Left-Hand Keyboard Panel.

- SUSTAIN LEVEL KNOB
After the Attack and Decay stages have been completed,
the Loudness Contour Generator will maintain the Volume
level determined by the Sustain Level knob for as long as a
note is held.
